# Userstyles.css

I'll put all the userstyles i've created and maintain for various websites/platforms.
Some styles may include design creations I made myself so please do not alter the images. Other than that, feel free to use my userstyles as a base for yours!

You must install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) before trying to install these or it will not work.

Styles can be updated automatically via the add-on.

## ü§ç Modernized MDL

This is not a theme but an alternative version of the website, trying to make it more modern & friendly. It will be directly imported into my project [Better MDL](https://dear-clouds.carrd.co/#better-mdl).

You can easily import this in your own theme like this

```css
@import "https://rawcdn.githack.com/dear-clouds/userstyles/b480966f7de1111223e1cae35faafde4cf0400b1/mydramalist/MDLModernized.css";
```

### 01. MDL Darker Version

  <img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l9gvd7z4jfdjozf/Presentation.jpg" width="500"/>
</p>

This was the base for Modernized.css but it hasn't been updated since then and is honestly awful to read. I'll rewrite it after releasing [Better MDL](https://dear-clouds.carrd.co/#better-mdl).

Using the soothing pastel theme Catppuccin which contains 5 variations (1 Light Mode & 4 Dark Modes) with customization of the main color. 
This is my most recent theme which can be used as a template to see how to import Modernize.css.
