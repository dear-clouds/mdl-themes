# Userstyles.css

I'll put all the userstyles i've created and maintain for various websites/platforms.
Some styles may include design creations I made myself so please do not alter the images. Other than that, feel free to use my userstyles as a base for yours!

You must install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) before trying to install these or it will not work.

Styles can be updated automatically via the add-on.
